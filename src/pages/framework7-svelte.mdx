# Framework7 Svelte



I am excited to announce that **Framework7-Svelte** is finally here and available from Framework7 v5.4.0! üéâ

Now we can build ***cybernetically enhanced*** web, desktop and mobile apps with native look and feel!

If you are not familiar with Svelte:
> Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the *browser*, Svelte shifts that work into a *compile step* that happens when you build your app.
> Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes.

Svelte will make your apps faster, with less and more clear code to write, and with built-in state management and reactivity.

## Usage

Usage is pretty simple, straightforward and similar to what we have in Framework7-Vue/React. For example:

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/c430cbb85394a538c9c702cb8ad9a29b" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

And we will get the following output:
